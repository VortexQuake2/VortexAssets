Model description       : The Terran Marine unit from Blizzard's Starcraft.
			  If you've played the game, you'll recognize this chap.

Other info              : What else needs to be said about this model...you either know it or you don't.

			  I'll probably convert this model to Q3, it should be fairly easy to do and work pretty well in the
			  seperat upper/lower body format.  It'll also give me a LOT more room to map all these little bits and pieces,
			  and best of all...it won't be the Q2 palette!  WOO HOO!

			  I'll never, ever understand how that damn palette works.  You should see what my test cube looks
			  like in OpenGL mode.  Maybe you have...maybe you can explain why it looks that way.

Thanks to               : R13 and the Q2PMP community for offering advice and help
			  and generally just being a nice bunch to hang around.
			  Great site, have to see it.  http://www.planetquake.com/Q2PMP

			  MrRogers, who offered to do a skin for the terran,
			  but unfortunatly got tied up with other projects and
			  just wasn't gonna be able to get to it anytime soon.
			  Man, it woulda been sweet. Que sara, sara.
			  I still appreciate the offer, and I guess we're now even ; )

			  Shine, for coming up with a very interesting skin for the terran.
			  I kinda like what this kid's done...it looks NOTHING like a terran marine,
			  but it's interesting to say the least.

			  Blizzard, who amazed me with their unGODly talent in creating and executing one of the
			  damn finest computer games ever.

* Play Information *

New Sounds              : NO, but would be very easy to snag them from Starcraft or Brood wars if anyone's intersted.  I
			  managed to get the in-game sounds...but I'd like to get ahold of the dialogue from the mission
			  briefings and other from the storyline.  Anyone know how to do this?
CTF Skins               : Yep...and I like the way they turned out.
VWEP Support            : Nope, sorry.  I would have given it standerd id weapon support, but I'm still wating for someone
			  to reskin them in a GL friendly size.  Anyone be intersted in helping with a project like that?

* Construction *
Poly Count              : 801 (Thanks, R13)
Vert Count              : 807
Skin Wastage		: 6%
Skin Count              : 15 skins, 2 CTF skins, 17 total.  Should be enough for ya.
Base                    : New model.  I tried modifying Evil Bastard's Sidney model..but it just wasn't working ; P
Editor used             : 3DS Max 2.5, Character Studio 2.1, Q2 Modeler, NST, Corel Photo-Paint
Known Bugs              : A lot of clipping problems with the shin guards, TONS of clipping problems in the shoulder guards.
			  I just could not figure out a way to get the shoulder guards to only rotate along the one axis using CS,
			  so I said ta hell with it and left them static.  I could have adjusted the animations so that nothing would
			  self-intersect...but it would have severly limited the range of motion I could have used.  So I chose
			  freedom of movement over clipping.
			  
			  There's an overall mis-proportion of the figure, by the time I figured out why he looked
			  so odd, it was too late to fix.  So he's just not as bulky and stocky as he should
			  be.  I'll be doing a bit of resizing for Q3

			  In retrospect, I'm not terribly pleased with the way I laid out the mapping.  I really didn't leave myself,
			  or anyone else for that matter, enough space to work in in a lot of pretty big areas.  Had I to do
			  it over again, I would have done it differenlty.  I finally realized that in my zealous to get as low skin
			  wasteage as I could, I left my self with a lot of warped mapping.
			  I now know better, and shan't be doing it again.
			  There was a lot more I could have mirrored, but I chose not to in this case to leave skinners as much
			  freedom in adding graffitti anywhere they wanted.
			  Of course, with that freedom came a severe limit on size...so now you can do what you want, but it probably
			  won't read.  Still, I think it's pretty easy to follow, and should
			  make custom skinning pretty easy.  Hell, if I can skin it...

			  This whole project was an exercise in working with a very specific facecount, not just a limit.
			  The model is exactly 1 face over the limit for the Q2PMP...but Rouge13 graciously allowed it in jest one day, so I was
			  gonna be damned if I didn't use it.  So no complaints about the face count, you better believe that
			  I know EXACTLY what it is, and it wasn't gonna be a single face more or less.
			  I am, however, more than open to suggestions about WHERE I should have put those 801 faces.

			  Yes, the faces are snagged from id skins...shhhh.

Build/Animation time    : Build took a week or two off and own, animation took about 6-8 hours altogether to lay out,
			  dunno how much time I spent redoing anims or tweaking what I had.  I don't really
			  get to work on it for any extended length of time, just little snatches here and there...
			  so it's really hard to keep track of how long it took.  This was my first experience with Character
			  Studio...so a lot of time was spent just learning how it works.

			  This is also my first real skin ever, and I found a nifty way of doing it which allows me to go
			  to the base layer and change the material/color, and get a fully done skin in a matter of minutes.
			  Which is why there's so many skins released with this one.  They're not the best skins in the world,
			  but they get the job done...and they're pretty close to what I had originally envisioned anyway.


* How to use this model *

Preheat oven to 350 degrees, place model on an ungreased cookie sheet, cover with foil and place on the center rack.
Cook for 45 minutes, or until golden brown.

Afterwards, unzip this into a Quake2/baseq2/players/terran directory.  The rest, I think you can figure out.

If it's not working, don't email me, it worked when it left here.  Stop by the Q2PMP site for all your trouble-shooting needs.

This Zip comes packed with one skin, which is enough to get you up and running without a huge download.
The other skins I have done are available in a seperate download.  If you like this PPM, download the other skins...it's a
big enough assortment of colors and characters to satisfy you cravings for individuality.  Plus it has my personal skin,
DON'T USE IT...IT'S MINE!!  Thanks : )

I heartily encourage EVERYONE to make a custom skin.  There are Eight color variations, based on the colors from the multiplayer
game of Starcraft, which should give you plenty of choices for a "base" skin...but it is very appropriate for you to scribble
graffitti al over the damn thing.  That's the best thing about the marines from the game, they all have all sorts of
nifty crap scrawled over the suits.  Have fun!

This model is exclusivly released through the Q2PMP site...if you didn't get it there,
chances are wherever you got it from did.

Contact me before using this model for any conversions or mods...There was someone a LONG time ago
working on a Starcraft mod, who asked me to build this.  I didn't have time then, but if they still want it...
well here it is, no?

Don't try sell this model or make money from the model in ANY shape, form, or fashion.
It's not mine, it sure as hell isn't yours, and there's probably no quicker way
to get it pulled from the internet entirely.  I don't want to get any nasty letters from Blizzard...so let's all use
some common sense here, ok?

I'll take job offers from Blizzard though! : )
Or job offers from ANY game company for that matter. = )

I didn't make this model for a clan, so if you're a clan thinking of adopting this as your clan model...I'm flattered,
but it would be better if you Made a skin.  If you don't know how, get someone else to or contact me and I might make one for you...
but don't harass other people for using the model claiming it to be your clan model.
And if someone harrasses you for using it, tell em to blow off.  Then plug em with the railgun while their typing
their complaints.
