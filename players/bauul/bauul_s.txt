					-Bauul PPM Soundpak-

FOLEY INFO: All of the growls came to you courtesy of my voice box. All of the neat
little death phrases came to you courtesy of that same voice box and no I didn't lower
my voice with any aid of the wav modifier(I've always had a low voice), although I did 
add the echos (I'm not THAT cool). Background sounds are some wavs from "Dark Omen".

I had been working on this soundpak off and on for the past couple weeks but I couldnt think of
a model it would be best suited for until EvilBastard put out Bauul. I hope it does the
model some justice. You be the judge. It's probably a little chincy to some, but not any 
moreso than a lot of fantasy games :)
