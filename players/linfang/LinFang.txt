Model description       : 

	LinFang is a Shao-lin grandmaster. Much like Santa, LinFang keeps a list of those who have been naughty... He doesn't concern himself with the nice ones.

Other info              : 
	LinFang is my first model made with NST v0.9b1. I was a HUGE fan of 0.76 and the new         version is much MUCH! better. I got my texture waste down to 10%. I haven't even         looked at the skin/fx yet.

Thanks to               :
