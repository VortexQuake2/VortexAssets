Description       : 

	This is a viewable weapons set for the Alita model by EvilBastard. Still a little glitchy but it's better than nothing. A new skin that I got from someone playing Lithium and sounds are also included. Note: these sounds are just the generic female sounds copied over to the directory but better than her sounding like a guy.
